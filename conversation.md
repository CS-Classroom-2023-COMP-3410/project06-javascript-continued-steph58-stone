# Next Button Redesign

## PROMPT 1

script08.jsJavaScriptproject08.htmlFilestyles08.cssFileThis is a story based game about plants, I want you to change the next button to look like a flower or plant

## RESPONSE 1

I will modify the styles in `styles08.css` to make the "Next" button look like a flower or a plant. First, I need to confirm where the "Next" button is implemented. Since it isn't explicitly mentioned in `project08.html`, it is likely dynamically created in `script08.js`. I will check that file and then update the CSS accordingly.

## RESPONSE 2

I will examine `script08.js` to identify how the "Next" button is created and referenced. Then, I will update the styling to make it look like a flower or plant.

## RESPONSE 2

I have checked `script08.js` and will now update `styles08.css` to make the "Next" button look like a flower or plant.

## RESPONSE 3

I've updated the styles to make the "Next" button look like a flower. Let me know if you want any adjustments to its appearance!

## PROMPT 3

So there isn't a next button labeled "next" in the html. lets create a little select button on the side of each choice that's a flower

## RESPONSE 4

I've updated the styles to include a flower-shaped select button next to each choice. Let me know if you'd like any further refinements!

## PROMPT 4

I would like you to also edit the html and java script files please

## RESPONSE 5

Now, I will update the HTML file (`project08.html`) to include the flower select button alongside each choice.

## RESPONSE 5

I've updated the HTML file to structure the choices dynamically. Now, I will modify the JavaScript file (`script08.js`) to ensure the flower select button appears next to each choice and functions correctly.

## RESPONSE 6

I've updated the JavaScript file to dynamically create the flower select button next to each choice. Let me know if you need further modifications!

## PROMPT 6

You totally broke my code, go back to the old javascript and html and then add a little flower icon on the left side of each anwer

I've restored the original HTML and JavaScript files while adding a small flower icon to the left of each answer. Let me know if you need any further refinements!
