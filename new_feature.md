I found this process to be very fascinating, and unfourtunetly short lived. I only asked it to add one feature and it tragically failed. I wanted to add a button on the side of each answer to my question and I wanted that button to be in the shape of a flower. This is something that chatgpt should be able to do as it's just css and a button feature. 
Interestingly, chatgpt completly scraped all of the past work from the website that was working and proceeded to only add a css design with an id that didn't exist. After trying again, it killed my javascript to where none of my buttons worked at all.
